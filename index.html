  <h1>Product engineer for Upstream</h1>
  <h2>About Radicle</h2>
  <p>
    Radicle is a new kind of code collaboration network built entirely on open protocols. <a href="https://twitter.com/lftherios/status/1364574015923367940">Read more about it here.</a>
  </p>
  <h2>About Upstream</h2>
  <p>
    Upstream is a client for the Radicle ecosystem. It’s main focus is to deliver an integrated user experience. It combines the peer-to-peer code collaboration protocol, called <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">link</a>, with a set of <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-contracts">Ethereum smart contracts</a> to create a way of collaborating around code that is native to the emerging decentralized web3 space.
  </p>
  <h2>Your role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As part of the product team, you'll take features from ideation to implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drive features from start to finish with the design and engineering teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      Positioned between design and engineering, you'll own the design system and you'll be tasked to make it open source friendly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collaborate and come up with interesting solutions with other projects in the crypto/p2p space. You're comfortable being the engineer in the room when we chat with other teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      Balance rapid prototyping with the design team and comprehensive feature development with the engineering team.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What we’re looking for</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Thoughtful problem-solving:</strong> For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You’re comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shipping quality user interfaces:</strong> You have an eye for design and care maintaining a high level of design quality throughout the app. You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for an open source project, using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and Svelte.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Familiarity with decentralized systems:</strong> You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. It would be great if you were familiar with peer-to-peer technology, both its power and its drawbacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open source oriented:</strong> Open source is at the core of your work, you understand the value in making our project open to others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Crypto native:</strong> You think crypto has a place in the future of the world and you want to help shape that future. As a plus, you’ve developed dApps on Ethereum and are familiar with its developer ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Put users first:</strong> You think critically about the implications of what you’re building, and how it shapes real people’s lives. You understand that decentralization comes at a UX cost and are keen to find solutions to improve that.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Not ideological about technology:</strong> To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you’re not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Empathetic communication:</strong> You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you’re explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Team player:</strong> You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The team & how we work</h2>
  <p>
    We’re composed of 4 core team members, 2 engineers and 2 designers, and everyone in the team codes. We are all contracting for the <a href="https://radicle.foundation">Radicle Foundation</a> with whom we set our yearly goals and check in on progress monthly. Other than that we are entirely self directed. We work as a team, making decisions together but all have our core areas which we drive individually. We work fully remote and with absolute flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the decentralized nature of the project, we all contract as freelancers or business entities for the Radicle Foundation. You'll set a day rate and can choose to be paid in traditional currency or cryptocurrency. As contractors, we have no employment benefits but are compensated well and you'll own a part of the network.
